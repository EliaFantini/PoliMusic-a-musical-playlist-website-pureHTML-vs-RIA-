PoliMusic is a website that lets the user upload his songs on a server. The project was made for the course Information Technology for the Web (2020/2021) and its aim was to build from scratch a website. Designed with a fresh and minimal UI (using CSS only), the user can create albums and playlists, and associate them to the songs he uploaded. The user can listen to each song through an audio player.

The same website has been made in two versions:
- Pure HTML (thin Client): the client-side code utilizes HTML only, whereas the server-side uses Java EE and Thymeleaf
- Rich Internet Application (thick Client): in this version, the client-side code utilizes HTML and Javascript. This version's website includes the possibility to reorder songs inside a created playlist. 
<br />
The server was made using Apache Tomcat 9 and the database was made with MySQL Workbench (an installation guide is included in the files).

The project uses the following languages: Java, Javascript, CSS, HTML, SQL.

## How to install
The installation process is quite long and requires the download of different softwares (MySQL Workbench, EclipseIDE, Apache Tomcat 9), a detailed explanation of how to do so is written in the file *Installation Guide Eclipse-Tomcat-MySQL-JDBC.pdf*.
## How to import the project
The two versions of the project have been uploaded as a .war file to be imported into Eclipse IDE (*TIW_Project_Playlist.war* and *TIW_Project_Playlist_RIA.war*). For other IDE, all the single files have been uploaded too, in the HTML_Pure and RIA folders respectively.

The database structure has been uploaded as an SQL file (*DatabaseBuilder.sql*).
