## Musical Playlist
- The aim of the project is to build from scratch a website that lets the user upload his songs on a server. 
- Designed with a fresh and minimal UI (using CSS only), the user can create albums and playlists, and associate them to the songs he uploaded. The user can listen to each song through an audio player.

The same website has been made in two versions:
- Pure HTML (thin Client): the client-side code utilizes HTML only, whereas the server-side uses Java EE and Thymeleaf
- Rich Internet Application (thick Client): in this version, the client-side code utilizes HTML and Javascript. This version's website includes the possibility to reorder songs inside a created playlist. 
<br />
The server was made using Apache Tomcat 9 and the database was made with MySQL Workbench (an installation guide is included in the files).

The project uses the following languages: Java, Javascript, CSS, HTML, SQL.

### How to import the project
The two versions of the project have been uploaded as a .war file to be imported into Eclipse IDE. For other IDE, all the single files have been uploaded too.
The database structure has been uploaded as an SQL file.
